## Hi, I'm Iman 👋

I'm a senior mobile engineer based in Amsterdam. I've been building mobile apps for **10+ years**, with a mix of **Android (Kotlin/Java)** and **Flutter (Dart)**.

I like building products that feel fast and solid, and I care a lot about clean structure and good UI details. I also enjoy sharing what I learn through open source and small write-ups.

### A few things about what I work on
- 📱 Mobile apps end-to-end: from architecture to release
- 🧩 Flutter + native Android (I’m comfortable in both)
- ⚖️ Shipping with a balance: clean code, but not over-engineered
- 🎨 UI/UX implementation (I’m picky about details 😄)
- 🎮 A bit of game development on the side (Godot, Cocos Creator, Flame)

### Open source / writing / videos
- 📊 I maintain **[fl_chart](https://github.com/imaNNeo/fl_chart)** (7.5k+ ⭐)
- ✍️ I write about UI challenges at **[flutter4fun.com](http://flutter4fun.com)**
- 🎥 I also share dev videos on YouTube: **https://www.youtube.com/@imaNNeO**

⚡ Fun fact: I picked **NeO** as my nickname before watching *The Matrix*.
